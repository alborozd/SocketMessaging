============
* Client and server can communicate by messages instead of packets

Engineering tasks
=================
o Changing message mode retriggers new message events
o DelimiterBound mode splits packets by delimiter
o PrefixedLength messages begin with an INT32 describing the message length
o Switching message mode affects the unread stream
o Data read from raw stream is removed from the messages-stream
o Data read as a message is removed from the raw stream
o Messages are limited by MaxMessageSize. Throws an exception if a message is read that is larger than max size
o Reading the raw stream is not limited by MaxMessageSize
o MaxMessageSize can be increased or lowered during communication and affects the unread stream




Known Problems
==============
o Connection.Poll() throws exception if socket closes just before checking if this.Available > 0.
