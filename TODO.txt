User stories
============
* Client and server can communicate by messages instead of packets
o Should support multiple delimiters?
o Send should take an IEnumerable<byte> instead of byte[]

Engineering tasks
=================
* Possible bug. Don't think this happens any more:
	Start with readIndex = 0
	Write to end of queue so _writeIndex = _queue.Length. (doesn't wrap to 0 because readIndex = 0??)
	Read entire queue so _readIndex = _writeIndex (= at end of queue). 
	Write something and then read without crashing.
o Cant use message delimiter as escape code
o MaxMessageSize can be increased or lowered during communication and affects the unread stream
	o Fixed sized messages should support longer than 65535 byte messages (initial MaxMessageSize of Connection)
o Change setters for Delimiter and Escapecode to methods that triggers MessageReceived events just like SetMode() does
o Write proper tests for Connection.appendEscapeCodes() and Connection.removeEscapeCodes()
o Sending messages larger than MaxMessageSize should throw IllegalOperationException



Known Problems
==============
o Connection.Poll() throws exception if socket closes just before checking if this.Available > 0.
