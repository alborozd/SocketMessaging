============
o Send should take an IEnumerable<byte> instead of byte[]
o SetDelimiter() should support single bytes, strings and chars.
	o Changing message encoding should change delimiter bytes IF set as char or string?
o Attach/Detach/Create new from existing socket
o Read end of queue after connection is lost
o Should support multiple delimiters?
o MaxMessageSize can be increased or lowered during communication and affects the unread stream
	o Fixed sized messages should support longer than 65535 byte messages (initial MaxMessageSize of Connection)
o Connection must trigger event to stop/start sending due to slow client. Throw exception if not adhering

Engineering tasks

Known Problems

o Connection.Poll() throws exception if socket closes just before checking if this.Available > 0.
