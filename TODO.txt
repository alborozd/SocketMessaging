o Attach/Detach/Create new from existing socket

	o Fixed sized messages should support longer than 65535 byte messages (initial MaxMessageSize of Connection)
	o Should trigger a bad-message-format event when a message is larger than MaxMessageSize
	o Should trigger a bad-message-format event when length-prefixed messages have negative length
o Changing message encoding should change delimiter bytes IF set as char or string?
