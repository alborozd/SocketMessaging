User stories
============
* Client and server can communicate by messages instead of packets
o Send should take an IEnumerable<byte> instead of byte[]
o SetDelimiter() should support single bytes, strings and chars.
	o Changing message encoding should change delimiter bytes IF set as char or string?
o Attach/Detach/Create new from existing socket
o Read end of queue after connection is lost
o Should support multiple delimiters?
o MaxMessageSize can be increased or lowered during communication and affects the unread stream
	o Fixed sized messages should support longer than 65535 byte messages (initial MaxMessageSize of Connection)

Engineering tasks
=================
o Sending messages larger than MaxMessageSize should throw IllegalOperationException
o Check that reading/writing is thread safe vs poolling thread
o Send(byte[]) should be renamed SendRaw() or Write(), so send(byte[]) sends messages



Known Problems
==============
o Connection.Poll() throws exception if socket closes just before checking if this.Available > 0.
o Write proper tests for Connection.appendEscapeCodes() and Connection.removeEscapeCodes()
o Should not trigger receivedMessage event when an escaped delimiter is found in a delimited message
