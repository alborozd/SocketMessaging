User stories
============
* Client and server can communicate by messages instead of packets
o Should support multiple delimiters?
o Send should take an IEnumerable<byte> instead of byte[]

Engineering tasks
=================
* Change setters for Delimiter and Escapecode to methods that triggers MessageReceived events just like SetMode() does
o Can send empty array in lengthPrefixed mode
o MaxMessageSize can be increased or lowered during communication and affects the unread stream
	o Fixed sized messages should support longer than 65535 byte messages (initial MaxMessageSize of Connection)
o Write proper tests for Connection.appendEscapeCodes() and Connection.removeEscapeCodes()
o Sending messages larger than MaxMessageSize should throw IllegalOperationException



Known Problems
==============
o Connection.Poll() throws exception if socket closes just before checking if this.Available > 0.
