# How to contribute

If you find a bug or other issue you report it under Issues here on GitHub. The same goes for requests for improvements. To avoid duplicate work, please take a minute to check if the issue has already been reported. If "your" issue already exists you are most welcome to chip in with your insights or a simple "Me too".

If you want to do more good you can try to solve a reported issue. Please comment in the issue that you want to take a stab at it to avoid multiple contributors working on the same issue.

To solve an issue:
* fork the project
* fix the code inside your fork
* commit and push your fork
* create a pull-request

You must [sign the Contribution Assignment Agreement (CAA)](https://www.clahub.com/agreements/aquamoth/SocketMessaging) before your pull-request will be merged. This a one-time requirement for projects copyrighted by Trustfall AB. You can read more about [Contribution License Agreements on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement). However, you don't have to do this up-front. You can simply clone, fork, and submit your pull-request as usual. The pull-request will however not be flagged as `mergable` until the CAA is signed.

Signing a CLA/CAA might sound scary but it's actually very simple and can be done in less than a minute. If you want to you can [sign the Contributor Assignment Agreement](https://www.clahub.com/agreements/aquamoth/SocketMessaging) right now.
